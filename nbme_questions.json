    "content": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents because of a 1-month history of intermittent right knee pain that has worsened during the past day. He rates his current pain as a 6 on a 10-point scale and says that it worsens when he walks and lessens when he sits. During the past 2 weeks, he has been walking 1 mile daily in preparation for participation in the school marching band. He has not taken any medications for his pain. He sustained a right tibia and fibula fracture at the age of 8 years after a skateboarding accident, which was treated with internal fixation and casting. He has asthma treated with inhaled budesonide daily and inhaled albuterol as needed. His mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus, and his maternal grandmother has osteoporosis. The patient is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in; 77th percentile) tall and weighs 88 kg (195 lb; >95th percentile); BMI is 31 kg/m2 (98th percentile). Temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 95/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows hyperpigmented, thickened skin at the nape of the neck. There is tenderness to palpation of the anterior aspect of the right hip and limited range of motion on abduction, internal rotation, and flexion of the right hip. The left hip and knees are nontender; range of motion is full in all directions. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following factors in this patient’s history most increased his risk for developing this condition?",
